The Form Serialization Library for PHP is the PHP `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` serialization library implementation.

A [Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota) generated project will need a reference to a form serialization package to handle `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` payloads from a supporting API endpoint.

Read more about Kiota [here](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota/blob/main/README.md).
